# Campus Diary

This website is inspired by LinkedIn, but it offers much more than just its inspiration. It is incredibly user-friendly and offers a variety of diverse options. How, you ask? Campus Diary connects you with your peers and alumni directly. It's possible that you may not know the names of some of your underrated alumni, making it difficult to find them on social media. With the help of Campus Diary, you can easily discover and connect with them. Additionally, for students studying in tier 3 colleges, it can be challenging to find societies or clubs that interest them. With Campus Diary, you can join various clubs of your choice without any restrictions imposed by the college. You can discover what is happening in other colleges and network with like-minded individuals.

Campus Diary also provides information on recent events in your vicinity, such as hackathons, meetups, internship opportunities, and job openings. However, what about exams? The only area where college students tend to struggle is finding notes. Campus Diary has solved this problem by providing past papers from your college/university, as well as well-structured notes from alumni.

Overall, Campus Diary is an incredibly useful and comprehensive platform for college students and alumni alike.
